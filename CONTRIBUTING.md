## Bug Reports

If you find an issue that causes unintended behavior, please report it to us
through an issue if someone has not already done so. Be sure to include a small
example of how we can reproduce the unintended behavior.

## Feature Requests

We will gladly consider feature requests and, upon acceptance, implement them or
advise you on how to do so and submit a pull request. In either case, please get
in touch through an issue first, and we will discuss the feature request.

## User Support

Before asking for user support, attempt to answer your question by reading the
package documentation and [posts] on the [Bioconductor Support Site]. If you can
not answer your question, write a new post on the [Bioconductor Support Site]
and add the `MultimodalExperiment` tag.

## Pull Requests

We will welcome pull requests that fit within the scope of the package and help
resolve outstanding issues. If you would like to submit a pull request that adds
a feature, please get in touch through an issue first.
