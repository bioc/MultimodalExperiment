\description{
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a single healthy donor
were profiled by cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by
sequencing (CITE-seq) to generate single-cell antibody-derived tag sequencing
(\code{scADTseq}) and single-cell RNA sequencing (\code{scRNAseq}) data simultaneously;
the \code{scRNAseq} data was summed into pseudo-bulk RNA sequencing (\code{pbRNAseq})
data. The dimensions of resulting matrices were reduced to conserve storage
because these data are only used to demonstrate the functionality of the
\linkS4class{MultimodalExperiment} class.
