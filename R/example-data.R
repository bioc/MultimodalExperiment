#' MultimodalExperiment Example Data
#'
#' Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a single healthy donor
#' were profiled by cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by
#' sequencing (CITE-seq) to generate single-cell antibody-derived tag sequencing
#' (`scADTseq`) and single-cell RNA sequencing (`scRNAseq`) data simultaneously;
#' the `scRNAseq` data was summed into pseudo-bulk RNA sequencing (`pbRNAseq`)
#' data. The dimensions of resulting matrices were reduced to conserve storage
#' because these data are only used to demonstrate the functionality of the
#' [MultimodalExperiment-class] class.
